            <h2> Abdul Latiff Mohidin Career as a Art Figure </h2>
            <br>
            <p>Latiff's passion for painting and drawing was evident from an early age. At 11, he sold his first painting to the British Commissioner-General for Southeast Asia, Sir Malcolm MacDonald. He later came to be identified as "the magical boy with the gift in his hands" after his first exhibition at the Kota Raja Malay School in Singapore, a school that he attended before he flew to Berlin to further his artistic education.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Upon his return from Germany in 1964, he travelled throughout Indochina and the Malay world, establishing affinities and conversations with avant-garde artists and intellectuals of the time. This moment, which he evokes through the phrase “Pago Pago,” has found a significant place in writings on Southeast Asian art.</p>
            <br>
            <p>His artistic practice is often linked to his literary activities. He first became recognised as a poet when he published his collection of poems Sungai Mekong in 1971, which has since been translated into multiple languages. Like his art, his poetry is a methodological wandering that resists ideological systems and structures. It grapples with the position of vernacular cosmopolitanism within the story of global modernism, which still defaults to Europe. His literary and painterly world is also heavily informed by the writings of JORGE LUIS BORGES, CHAIRIL ANWAR and JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE amongst others. Breaking down disciplinary boundaries between the visual and literary, in 2012, Latiff Mohidin published his translation of Goethe's Faust (Part 1), a figure who has fascinated him since his encounter with German literature in the early 1960s.
            In 2018, he became the first Southeast Asian artist to be featured at the Centre Pompidou in Paris.</p>
